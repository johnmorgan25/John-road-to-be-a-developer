// How to conditionally run a code

let temp = 180;
//let isFreezing = temp <= 32;

if (temp <= 32) {
  console.log("It is freezing outside");
}

if (temp >= 110) {
  console.log("It is way too hot outside");
  console.log("test123");
}

// This is known as flow control because we control the flow of our program
