What is programming?
--> programming is giving a computer specific sequential orders 
--> It is like following a recipie 

What is programming language?
--> programming languages (like normal languages) are set of rule that are standard so computer can understand them 
--> They are meant to be understandable by computers and by other programmers

Why there are many programming languages?
--> We use computers for a lot of different uses, each programming language is tailored for use(s)

Source code?
--> It is the syntax that is rewuired to be written within the programming language set of rules so the computer can do the task

IDE  or text editor?
--> We can't use a word processor for writing the source code
--> IDE provide more tools for progrmming than the text editor

How to run code? 
--> Writing the source code doesn't make it understandable
--> We need to run the source code so it can do the task that the code was built to do 
--> There are three ways to run the code:
1- Compiler            --> Takes a high level programming language and turns it into an excutable low level programming language (no need for source code)
2- Interpreter         --> process source code every time line by line (like javascript) 
3- combination of both --> like python and Java 
--> The difference between compiling and interpreting is blury nowadays 

IDE 
--> Integrated Development Environment 
--> provide the tools for writing, Debugging, and testing programs 
--> X-code --> Used for Apple products
