(Introduction)
HTML is widely used on web

It is mainly the content of the web 
It is very vital for communication between people and between machines


(The role o HTML)
- The web is programmed using three programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage --> It marks up the website
CSS stands for cascading syle sheeet --> It is used to make website visually pleasent and make simple animation 
JavaScript is used for adding logic and functionality to the website

The web differs from any programming 
-- Web is designed to run on any operating system (mac, windows, linux,  ...)
-- Every web page ever made very long ago is still running now 
-- web is designed to be ropust and powerful 

(HTML Syntax)
-- HTML is based on tags 
-- tags are something like <p> which is paragraph tag 
-- the syntax is very simple but the question is which for which 
-- tags are mainly divided into opening tags and closing tags 
-- <p> this is an opening tag
-- </p> this is closing tag 
-- the whole thing is called an element ( opening tag + content + closing tag )
-- some elements don't have an ending tag
-- tags can be nested inside each others 
-- structure nesting is very important for the browser 
-- Browser build DOM tree and accessibility tree 
-- one of the most common mistakes in HTML is forgetting to add the losing tag
