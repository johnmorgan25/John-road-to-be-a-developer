(Introduction)
HTML is widely used on web

It is mainly the content of the web 
It is very vital for communication between people and between machines


(The role o HTML)
- The web is programmed using three programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage --> It marks up the website
CSS stands for cascading syle sheeet --> It is used to make website visually pleasent and make simple animation 
JavaScript is used for adding logic and functionality to the website

The web differs from any programming 
-- Web is designed to run on any operating system (mac, windows, linux,  ...)
-- Every web page ever made very long ago is still running now 
-- web is designed to be ropust and powerful 

(HTML Syntax)
-- HTML is based on tags 
-- tags are something like <p> which is paragraph tag 
-- the syntax is very simple but the question is which for which 
-- tags are mainly divided into opening tags and closing tags 
-- <p> this is an opening tag
-- </p> this is closing tag 
-- the whole thing is called an element ( opening tag + content + closing tag )
-- some elements don't have an ending tag
-- tags can be nested inside each others 
-- structure nesting is very important for the browser 
-- Browser build DOM tree and accessibility tree 
-- one of the most common mistakes in HTML is forgetting to add the losing tag

(paragraphs)
-- paragraphs are made like this <p> paragraph </p> 

(headlines)
-- web pages hhave a lot of titles ( headlines and subheadines )
-- There are six slements for headline h1, h2,......., h6
-- h1 is the biggest headline and h6 is the most little one
-- h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 > h6
-- we will make a choice based on what does it mean not how does it look
-- It helps a lot with accessibility


(bold and italic)
-- there are two elements for bold and two elements for italic
-- verbally emphasized VS. visually represented
-- <i> --> etalic used only for visual representation
-- <em> --> etalic used for emphasizing some content
-- <b>  --> visual-only bold
-- <strong> --> represent important words


(lists)
HTML contains
1- unordered lists  <ul> --> <li>
2- ordered lists    <ol> --> <li>
3- definition lists <dl> --> <dd>, <dt>

(Quotes)
<block quotes> is used for a block of quote
<cite>         is used for citation
<q>            is used for quotes inside another content like paragraphs


(dates and times)
only one element for anything related to date and time
<time> 
datetime attribute is used to set date, time zone, and time

(HTML entities)
&lt; --> opening
&gt; --> closing
 Those two are very useful in case we are writing about HTML elements

<br> --> line break --> a simple tag that makes a break 
<pre> --> an element that makes browser observe each whitespace in the content of the pre tag


(subscripts, super scripts, and amall texts)
<sub> --> like 2 in H2O
<sup> --> like 8 in 10^8
<small> --> for texts that we intend to write it small or not so important

(attributes)
some attributes works for single element 
and there are global attributes like:
 --class           --> used a lot with CSS 
 --id              --> used only once (not preferred)
 --contenteditable --> let the user edit the content   
 --dit = "rtl"\"ltr--> for texts that are read fromm left to right or from right to left

(ARIA rule)
 it is meant to make the web accessible for everyone, providing many tools to help people with disabilities

 (formatting)
 in HTML comments are like <!-- some comment -->

 (weird charecters)
  &copy;    --> makes a copy rights mark
  &trade;   --> makes a TM single
  &star;    --> makes a star
  &nbsp;    --> non breaking space


  (linking and navigation)

  links     --> <a href = "a website">anything</a>
href --> hypertext refrence
  ** we can make a local refrence (not on the internet) 
  ** Local refrences work only with local HTML files

  ** we can make a nvigation bar by making a list of the items in the bar with wrapping each element with an a element
    The whole unordered list shouldbe wrapped into <nav> element 

(images and graphics)

images  <img> 
attriputes: source attripute (src), alternative attribute (alt), width, height

image formats: Goal is High quality with Small file size
GIF: is the oldest and cab handle simple animation
SvG: uses vector graphics instead of pixels --> can vary in size with high quality
SVG --> Scalabale Vector graphics
JPG: it is compressable to very small size
PNG: it helps in images with the transperant parts

(responsive design for images)
We can let the browser and computer decide whichever image fits the screen resolution 
--> This an be done by using srcset attribute with comma separated sources for the image(s)


**captions can be made by <figcaption> element 
** The <img> and <figcaption> will be wrapped in <figure> element

** The <picture> element gives you the flexibility you need to change content as well as image size.
